## Introduction 
* However, there are several tools and techniques to fight phishing. 
* Today weâ€™ll focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
* Besides analyzing and categorizing email the moment it arrives, AI can do so on a larger scale much faster and more accurately when compared to the traditional model
